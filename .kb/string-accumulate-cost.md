# Turning many pieces into one string costs the TOTAL LENGTH

**Invariant: on ALL FOUR backends, building one string out of N pieces costs the sum of
the pieces, never the sum of the PREFIXES. The two portable ways a program has of doing it
-- `(apply #'concatenate 'string pieces)` and appending into a
`with-output-to-string` stream -- are both linear, and `uiop:read-file-string` is built out
of the second.** A cost invariant, not a semantic one; invisible at the sizes ci-spec and
the doc examples use, which is why regressions here survive.

The sibling of `.kb/string-index-cost.md`: that file is about a character INDEX, this one
about the ACCUMULATE. They were found together on the same file and are separate
mechanisms -- the index was fixed first (`.todo/690`) and the accumulate was what a real
program hit before it ever reached an index (`.todo/704`).

## The two shapes and what each used to cost
Measured 2026-09-06 (JDK 25, wasmtime 47) on a 2,668,890-character file, before -> after:

| shape | interpreter | JVM class | wasm-GC |
|---|---|---|---|
| `uiop:read-file-string` | 6,439 -> 3,498 ms | 18,164 -> **537** ms | (n/a) -> 3,426 ms |
| `read-line` loop + `(apply #'concatenate 'string lines)` | 404 -> 357 ms | 54,197 -> **357** ms | (n/a) -> 3,602 ms |

- **`uiop:read-file-string`** (`src/main/resources/am/ik/rontolisp/eval/uiop-stream.lisp`)
  read 4,096 characters at a time into `(setq acc (concatenate 'string acc chunk))`. Each
  chunk re-copied everything read so far: 3,127 chunks over the real Qwen3.5-0.8B
  `tokenizer.json` (12,807,982 bytes, 10,769,328 characters) is about 1.7e10 character
  copies, and at 134 s it was still inside `_strToCharVec` under `_toMutStr` under
  `READ-FILE-STRING`. It accumulates into a string OUTPUT STREAM now -- a `StringWriter`
  on the interpreter and the JVM, a `$str_bytes` buffer that DOUBLES on both wasm
  backends (`WasmStringStreamRuntimeBuilder`) -- so the chunks are appended, never
  re-copied. It costs nothing extra to reach for: `with-open-file` already puts the wasm
  module in EH mode, so the `with-output-to-string` inside it adds no gate.
- **`(apply #'concatenate 'string lines)`** -- the shape a caller writes by hand -- is the
  FIRST-CLASS `concatenate`, so on the compile paths it runs
  `BuiltinFunctionWrappers.concatenateWrapper`, whose string arm folded pairwise through
  `%string-concat`. 495,920 lines cost about 2.7e12 character copies; at 200 s it had not
  returned. The arm sizes the result ONCE now: `mapcar` normalizes each argument, a
  `reduce` sums the lengths, `make-string` allocates exactly that, and a second `reduce`
  carries the write offset while `replace` copies each piece in. The reduce's own
  accumulator is the offset, so nothing `setq`s a captured variable.
- **The INTERPRETER's `#'concatenate` is the Java builtin, not the wrapper**, and that one
  was already n-ary and linear -- which is why the second row barely moves there. The
  wrapper is a compile-path artifact.
- The in-repo caller of the second shape is `safetensors::%read-text`
  (`src/main/resources/am/ik/rontolisp/eval/safetensors.lisp`), which reads a
  `model.safetensors.index.json` line by line and joins it that way. It was quadratic on
  every compile path and needed no edit: the wrapper is where the cost was.

## The LIST family had the same bug with `append`
`concatenatedElements()` (the wrapper's list and vector arms) folded LEFT --
`(reduce (lambda (a x) (append a (coerce x 'list))) seqs :initial-value nil)` -- and
`append` copies its accumulator, so `(apply #'concatenate 'list lists)` was quadratic in
the total length too. It is a RIGHT fold now
(`:from-end t`, `(append (coerce x 'list) a)`), where each step copies only its own
argument's elements. The `nil` seed is still what copies the LAST argument, so the result
is a fresh list either way and the outer `(append ... nil)` the left fold needed is gone.

## What is deliberately NOT linear
- **The CALL-POSITION `(concatenate 'string a b c)`** still lowers to a nested binary
  `%string-concat` chain (`ConcatenateForms.stringChain`, `.kb/concatenate-result-families.md`).
  The argument count is written in the SOURCE there, so the chain's extra copying is
  bounded by the program text and never by the data; only the n-ary paths -- `apply` /
  `funcall` over a runtime list -- can be handed 495,920 arguments. Change this only if a
  macro is found generating a wide literal concatenate.
- **`(setq acc (concatenate 'string acc chunk))` in a LOOP is quadratic by construction on
  every backend** and no `concatenate` fix can help it: each call copies the accumulator.
  That is a shape to avoid in library Lisp, and the reason `read-file-string` no longer
  uses it. `with-output-to-string`, or `make-string` sized once and filled with `replace`,
  are the two answers to AVOIDING QUADRATIC -- both linear. They are not equally fast in
  absolute terms, though: `make-string` pays to fill its whole capacity every call, which
  makes a buffer that grows by doubling slower than `with-output-to-string` in practice
  ("The 'sized-once' alternative is not a win" below).

## The accumulate was never the whole cost of reading a file
It was not even most of it. What remained after this file's fix was the CHARACTER
`read-sequence`, which decoded and stored one code point per host read -- about 1.2 us per
character on the interpreter and wasm -- and that is fixed too
(`.kb/character-sequence-io.md`, `.todo/721`). On the same 2,668,890-character file,
before that second fix -> after (2026-09-12):

| | interpreter | JVM class | wasm-GC |
|---|---|---|---|
| `read-file-bytes` + `rontolisp:octets-to-string` | 249 -> 307 ms | 267 -> 321 ms | 144 -> 150 ms |
| `uiop:read-file-string` | 3,694 -> **366** ms | 539 -> **322** ms | 3,351 -> **349** ms |

**`uiop:read-file-string` is now at parity with reading the file as bytes and decoding
once**, so the byte-reader detour in `examples/llm/llm.lisp` and
`examples/llm/checkpoint-tokenizer.lisp` is no longer a cost REQUIREMENT -- it is kept for
what it also buys: one decode of one contiguous byte array, and an immutable
`java.lang.String` on the JVM, which is the representation `rontolisp:json-parse` is fast
over (`.kb/string-index-cost.md`). `.todo/704` asked whether they could drop it; the answer
is "they may now, and it would be a wash".

Of `read-file-string`'s remaining 366 ms on the interpreter, about 260 ms is the
`with-output-to-string` accumulate THIS file is about -- it is linear, but it is now the
larger half of reading a file into a string on every backend.

## The "sized-once" alternative is not a win: `make-string` FILLS the whole capacity
`.todo/786` asked whether the accumulate's remaining ~260 ms could be cut from three
character-touches (store into the read buffer, copy into the stream, render into the
result) to two, by replacing `with-output-to-string` with one `make-string` buffer that
DOUBLES on demand (`read-sequence buf in :start len`, answered as `(subseq buf 0 len)`).
Measured 2026-09-12 (JDK 25, wasmtime 47, Linux x64), both alternatives against the SAME
2,668,890-character file, steady state (5 reads in one process, mean of the last two):

| shape | interpreter | JVM class | wasm preview 1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `with-output-to-string`, 4,096-char chunk (current) | 72 ms | 217 ms | 246 ms |
| doubling `make-string` + `replace` + `subseq` | 106 ms (+47%) | 340 ms (+57%, GC-noisy) | 336 ms (+37%) |

**The doubling buffer LOSES on every backend measured**, not by a small margin. The reason
is `make-string`: `expandMakeString` lowers it to `(make-array n :element-type 'character
:initial-element #\Space)` (`.kb/adjustable-arrays.md`), so every `make-string` call pays
for FILLING its whole capacity, not just what the caller goes on to write. A doubling
buffer therefore fills its buffer TWICE across its lifetime (once as spaces at allocation,
once with `replace` copying the real data over the first half) plus the growth copy itself
-- three to four touches, not two, and the growth capacities sum to roughly 2x the final
size on top of that. Isolated: a bare loop that doubles a `make-string` buffer ten times to
4,194,304 characters (no I/O at all) costs 56 ms steady-state on the interpreter alone --
comparable to the ENTIRE baseline `read-file-string` (72 ms) for the same file. `replace`
and `subseq` are not the problem (they copy only real data); the unconditional
`:initial-element` fill is.

A second alternative -- keep `with-output-to-string` but grow the READ chunk from 4,096 to
65,536 characters, cutting the call count from 652 to 41 -- helps the interpreter on THIS
file (72 -> 52 ms, -28%) and is noise-level on the JVM and wasm (within run-to-run
variance). But `make-string`'s fill cost is paid on EVERY call regardless of the file's
real size, so a bigger fixed chunk is a tax on the common case instead: 1,000 reads of a
5-byte file, steady state, interpreter: 137 ms at a 4,096-char chunk, **511 ms (3.7x) at a
65,536-char chunk**. Sizing the chunk from the file is not portable either -- `file-length`
answers nil on both WASM backends (the comment already on `read-file-string`).

**Conclusion: `uiop:read-file-string` keeps its current shape.** Neither alternative is a
net improvement once the common (small-file) case is weighed against the one large file
the doubling shape was designed for. A real win needs a buffer allocation that skips the
CL `:initial-element` fill obligation -- an uninitialized-storage primitive `make-string`
cannot honestly be, since the language sizes the default fill from the array's own default
element (`.kb/adjustable-arrays.md`, "An array slot nobody wrote..."). Exposing one to
library Lisp (and auditing every `make-string` caller that currently relies on the fill,
e.g. anything reading uninitialized tail slots) is a separate, larger project than this
item's scope.

## Pinning
- ci-spec `string-accumulate-is-not-quadratic` (all four backends): 4,096 pieces of 64
  characters concatenated in ONE `apply #'concatenate 'string` against the same 262,144
  characters in 256 sixteen-piece calls -> `CONCAT-FLAT`; the same ratio over a
  `with-output-to-string` accumulator -> `STREAM-FLAT`; then `uiop:read-file-string`
  over a 4,500-character file it writes itself, for correctness across the 4,096-character
  read boundary.
  **Why the ratio is not over FILES**, which is what the invariant exists for: when this
  was written `read-sequence` cost about 1.2 us per character on the interpreter, so the
  accumulate did not dominate below roughly 1.2M characters and a file big enough to
  separate the two implementations cost tens of seconds per backend leg. Measured at
  786,432 characters, one file against 16 files of 48 KB: the old code's ratio was 12.5x on
  the JVM but only 1.53x on the interpreter and 3.8x on wasm -- undetectable under any
  bound that is not itself a flake. The two mechanisms `read-file-string` is MADE of are
  timed instead, at a size every backend finishes in milliseconds. **That premise moved on
  2026-09-12**: the character read is 23-39 ns per character now
  (`.kb/character-sequence-io.md`), so a file-sized ratio would separate cleanly today --
  re-open this if the in-memory pins ever prove too indirect.
- `JvmLispCompilerTest#compileANaryConcatenateCostsTheTotalLengthAndNotTheSumOfThePrefixes`
  (6,933 ms under the fold, 39 ms sized once) and
  `WasmLispCompilerIntegrationTest#aNaryConcatenateCostsTheTotalLengthAndNotTheSumOfThePrefixes`
  (19,037 ms -> 23 ms) -- the per-backend cost pins, where a timing verdict cannot take the
  shared corpus down with it.
- Correctness of the rewritten wrapper arms rides the existing
  `#compileAndRunConcatenateAsFunctionValue` /
  `#concatenateBuildsListAndVectorResultTypes` family and the mutable-result pins in
  `.kb/string-write-runtime.md`.
