# do-symbols

`(do-symbols (var [package [result]]) body...)`

Evaluates the body once per symbol ACCESSIBLE in `package` -- the current package
when omitted -- with `var` bound to the symbol, then evaluates `result` with
`var` bound to nil and returns its value (nil when no result form is given).
Accessible means the symbols the package owns, internal and external alike, plus
the exports it inherits through its use list; each is spelled against the package
that owns it, so a package using `cl` yields the bare `cl` names. The package's own
symbols come in sorted order -- sorted by the spelling that names each one's OWNER,
so an inherited name sorts under the package it comes from rather than among the
local ones by bare name.

This works on every backend: the interpreter reads its live registry, and the
compiled backends answer from the package table baked in at compile time (plus
any package a [`make-package`](../functions/make-package.md) call creates at run
time). A `return` in the body exits the whole form -- the loop establishes the
implicit nil block every iteration macro has -- skipping the result form.

The example builds packages of its own rather than walking a built-in one, so the
whole set it visits is visible on the page. `ASHARED` and `ZSHARED` are reached only
because `ds-demo` uses `ds-base`, which is exactly what
[`do-external-symbols`](do-external-symbols.md) leaves out -- and they come FIRST
because the sort is on `ds-base:ashared`, not on `ashared`.

```lisp
(defpackage :ds-base (:export :ashared :zshared))
(defpackage :ds-demo (:use :ds-base) (:export :alpha :mine))
(let ((names nil))
  (do-symbols (s :ds-demo) (push (symbol-name s) names))
  (nreverse names)) ; => ("ASHARED" "ZSHARED" "ALPHA" "MINE")
```
